# Worldle

The goal of this project is to demonstrate code organization and architecture by making a simple "Worldle" clone.

Check out the original at https://worldle.teuteuf.fr/ to see how it plays.

## What's Included
- Check out `countries.json` for a list of countries to be used
- Each countries image can be found at `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gist/smoroden/4599bfcde936165187d7476cfc148101/raw/366b16d7d82a7d6ed9500cc3cddd6c8a57bb1076/[countryCode].svg`

## Basic Rules + Requirements
- A user can have up to 6 guesses.
- Previous guesses should be displayed with the distance and direction to the answer.
- If a user guesses correctly or runs out of guesses the countries name should be displayed and no more guesses are allowed.
- In this version we will allow unlimited plays. Add functionality to let the user play again after a round has ended.
